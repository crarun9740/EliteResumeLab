        <h2>PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY</h2>
        <p>
          Use this section as your "elevator pitch" - a concise explanation of
          why you're the right person for the job. Emphasize top skills
          (including personal traits that tell employers how you approach work),
          specific expertise, and any notable work experiences that match what
          the potential job needs. Keep this section to two to three sentences.
        </p>

      <section class="skills">
        <h2>SKILLS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Review the job posting and pick out key skills.</li>
          <li>Feature skills of your own that match these key skills.</li>
          <li>
            Your resume format determines how large your skills section is â€”
            functional resumes will feature several skill categories, while
            other formats will feature less.
